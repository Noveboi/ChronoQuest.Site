<TheoryBoard text="    In a quiet village, a curious girl named Elara found a hidden clearing in the forest. There, she met Tessa, a playful forest sprite who taught her the magic of nature—how to speak with animals and listen to the wind.
They spent many days exploring together, until one morning, Tessa was gone. In her place lay a tiny carved acorn, a gift of friendship and magic.
Elara never forgot her. Years later, she passed on the lessons to others, and the forest’s magic lived on through her stories." />
